This program computes consecutive arithmetic operations and prints the possible combinations
that reach a desired target number given a list of input numbers. To run, execute 
crazy_combine.py using python3 and follow the prompts. You have the option to enter a range of numbers
with variable step lenghts, as well as a custom list of numbers. Also you can choose to not print
the possible combinations and just display the number of solutions.
